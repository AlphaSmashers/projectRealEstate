# projectRealEstate

In the present-day market, It is typically difficult finding good real estate properties with reasonable prices on the internet is difficult, so the website I have created shows pictures of any real estate properties where buyers and sellers can connect. The website that I've built will show property locations of a particular area and images will be attached to it and it will also be listed at a fair reasonable price. The sellers can post the proper pictures and selling prizes in the description of the real estate property and the buyers can go online and can be able to see all the details needed. So I created a platform that will connect the buyer and seller, and as a result, the exact problem which was to get information about real estate properties can easily be solved with the product I built.
